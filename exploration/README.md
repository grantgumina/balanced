# how to use this

- install jupyter
    ```
    pip3 install --upgrade pip
    pip3 install jupyter
    ```
- run `jupyter notebook exploration.ipynb`
- install dependencies (I just did it globally because I'm bad)
    ```
    pip3 install psycopg2 python-igraph plotly
    ``` 
  * make sure you have PostgreSQL installed before doing this,  
    as well as Xcode command line tools if you are on OSX
- ask viraj for 'connection string' which goes near the top of the notebook
